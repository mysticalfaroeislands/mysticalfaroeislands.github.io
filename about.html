    <h3>Practical Information</h3><br>
    <p>#1 THE WEATHER IS UNPREDICTABLE<br>The reason for this huge weather variation is the Faroes position in the middle of the North Atlantic. Here, the warm waters of the Gulf Stream swirl around with the icy waters of the Arctic, creating the perfect melting pot for some pretty crazy weather concoctions.</p>
    <p>#2 ALWAYS PACK A RAIN JACKET, WARM JACKET, AND SOME SNACKS<br>The sun might be shining when you leave your hotel room in the morning, but when you're in the middle of a hike and the skies open up with pouring rain, you'll never regret throwing some warm waterproof gear in your daypack.</p>
    <p>#3 THE FAROE ISLANDS ARE PRIME BIRDWATCHING TERRITORY<br>To date, something like 305 species of seabirds have been found to inhabit the Faroes, which is insane when you consider the size of this tiny nation in the sea.</p>
    <p>#4 ENGLISH IS REALLY WIDELY SPOKEN IN THE FAROE ISLANDS<br>As in most Scandinavian countries, English is extremely widely (and often perfectly) spoken in the Faroes - which is super lucky considering Faroese is a seriously daunting language.</p>
    <p>#5 SHEEP RULE THE FAROE ISLANDS<br>They're generally free to wander wherever they please, which means you're likely to encounter them on the roads more than once. Always drive carefully, and if you come across a herd standing in the middle of the road just stop and wait for them to pass.</p>
    <p>#6 CREDIT CARDS ARE ACCEPTED EVERYWHERE<br>Faroe Islands are part of the Danish currency, the Danish króna (DKK). You do not need piles of cash when you are in the Faroe Islands as you can pay with different credit cards and debit cards everywhere.</p>
    <p>#7 PUBLIC TRANSPORT IS EXCELLENT BUT IT DOESN’T ALWAYS GO WHERE YOU WANT TO<br>Plan where you want to go in advance and see if the buses will get you there, otherwise you are probably better off hiring a car, at least for part of your trip.
    </p>
    <p>#8 THE FAROE ISLANDS ARE NOT A BUDGET DESTINATION, BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK<br>The Faroes have a reputation for being pretty expensive - but with a little forward planning and some smart budgeting, your travels there absolutely don't need to break the bank.</p>

      <p>Almost all of the roads are paved and really well maintained with only a few gravel exceptions. Roundabouts control the traffic in most cases (there are only 3 traffic lights in the entire country).</p>
      <p>But what really makes the Faroes the most incredible road trip destination is undoubtedly the views. Each corner and bend keeps you gasping and reaching for the camera; beautiful roads snaking through valleys, insane lookout points, and ever-present sea views make for some truly epic days on the road. </p>

    <h3>Nature</h3><br>
    <p>#1 GEOGRAPHY<br>One of Faroe Islands’ most renowned writers, William Heinesen (1900-1991), once called the capital of the Faroe Islands, Tórshavn, “The Navel of the World”.</p>
    <p>Seeing how small the islands are in comparison to the vast land and ocean surrounding them, it’s no wonder he described them in this way. The Faroe Islands are an archipelago made up of 18 rugged islands, separated by narrow sounds and fjords. These volcanic islands lie in the North Atlantic Ocean at 62º north and 6º47’ west, located about halfway between Scotland and Iceland.Their total land mass totals at 1,399 square kilometres, with a maritime economic zone covering 274,000 square kilometres and a population of nearly 50,000. The overall length of the archipelago from north to south is 113 kilometres and 75 kilometres from east to west.</p>
    <p>#2 CLIMATE<br>Let’s be straight. If you expect the climate in the Faroe Islands to include 30-degrees sun every day, with sweat constantly dripping from your forehead, and a duvet-less sleep, you have been slightly misinformed. Not to say this this isn’t possible (we once recorded 26 degrees!). It’s just not quite the norm.</p>
    <p>What surprises many, however, is the relative mildness of the Faroese seasons. Despite the islands’ northern latitude location, summers are cool with an average temperature of 13°C, and winters are mild, with an average temperature of 3°C. This climate, classed as Maritime Subarctic according to the Köppen climate classification, is influenced by the strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the North Atlantic Current.Summer days bring long hours of sunlight (19 hours, 45 minutes on the longest day, June 21). In contrast, days during the winter can be as short as 5 hours. The islands are generally windy, cloudy and cool throughout the year. Variations in altitude, ocean currents, topography and wind mean the climate differs greatly, even though distances between locations is small. This makes for unpredictable and highly changeable weather. It is not uncommon for one location to experience rain, the next snow, and a third location sun. You can literally experience all four seasons in one day!</p>
    <p>#3 NATURE<br>The splendid nature of the Faroe Islands is unmissable – quite literally. Whether you sail between fjords or fly between mountains upon arrival, you will be keenly greeted by spectacular nature, regardless of season.</p>
    <p>Verdant green valleys engulfed by steep dramatic mountains, protecting small picturesque villages with colourful turf-topped housed; all home to the freshest of air. The vast ocean is the backdrop to any location, with no place in the Faroe Islands distanced more than 5 kilometres from the North Atlantic.A journey into the mountains of the Faroe Islands will give you a sense of peace and liberation. The only audible sounds are those of running streams or birdsongs (and the occasional bleating sheep, of course!). The magnificent nature offers the perfect setting for an opportunity to step back and feel that sense of inner peace, a chance to hear that inner voice. Moments of complete relaxation.Nature in its whole is revered here. Its influence on local culture cannot be undervalued and its significance in shaping the islands’ inhabitants is profoundly evident in their character and way of thinking.</p>

    <h3>Culture</h3><br>
    <p>Nordic culture is at the core of the Faroe Islands. Due to its remote location and isolation from continental Europe, the islands have retained many of the traditional elements that even the Scandinavian countries have lost. Some of the most enduring elements of Faroese culture include storytelling (the islands have a strong oral tradition) as well as live music.</p>
    <p>#CUISINE<br>Meat, seafood, and potatoes are staples of the Faroese diet. Mutton is very common, while fish and whale meat (as well as whale blubber) are eaten throughout. Whale hunting is an enduring element of the island’s culture, though there are concerns with regards to the effects of the meat on humans as well as animal rights issues. Despite this, the hunt is not thought to severely impact the local whale population. The Faroe Islands are also home to two breweries, while the short British occupation resulted in a local fondness for fish and chips.</p>
    <p>#SPORTS<br>One of the most important sporting events in the Faroe Islands are the biennial Island Games – a multisport event contested between islands and small territories throughout Europe (including Jersey, Gibraltar, Åland, and many more). While Faroese compete as part of Denmark in the Olympics, the country is a full member of FIFA and UEFA, meaning it has its own national soccer team. While considered a minnow, the squad did record a famous victory over Greece in 2014.</p>
    <p>#FESTIVALS<br>e most important sight of the festival is the Faroese round dance, the oldest dance in Europe. It is performed without music, to the accompaniment of the long, monotonous ballads of the Viking times. The dance has pagan roots. Only the Faroers managed to convey it to us through the centuries of the Inquisition. Modern music can be heard at another summer festival, which is also very fond of the Faroe Islands. In addition to cultural festivals, Christian festivals are very fond of the theater.Opera and ballet performances, concerts can be seen in the “House of the North” in Torshavn. For tourists, there are held cultural events “Faroese evenings”. For example, the Faroese dance and dinner with fish dishes.</p>
    <p>#MIKINES - FATHER OF ART<br>Mikines is the painter of human life. He paints the land, the people, the immense sea. You can feel the salty sea and the salty tears in the heavily loaded boat in paintings such as Home from the Funeral.Mikines acknowledged his indebtedness to the artist Edvard Munch as well as his admiration for El Greco and Delacroix. The best place to see paintings by Mikines is to visit the Art Museum in Tórshavn.   </p>
